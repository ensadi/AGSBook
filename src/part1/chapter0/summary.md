# Summary

Let's review the important points we discussed in this chapter:

* **Adventure Game History** We discussed a little about what adventure games are and where they came from.
* **AGS is cool** 'Nuff said.
* **First Game** We created our first game with AGS.  Although it doesn't do much yet, you'll be adding to it throughout the rest of the book. We created the game using the Default template, which gives us basic functionality, like a main character, a simple room to walk around in, a mouse cursor with several different action modes, save/restore functionality, and a basic GUI style.
