# Chapter 4 - Interacting with Your World

Our game is coming along quite nicely at this point.  We have a main character that is fully animated, and she can walk around and visit 4 different rooms.  But we're far from finished yet.  After all, even though we've accomplished a lot, Foxy still can't really *do* anything yet. All she can do is walk.  There are several more actions that the player can do, and we'll start to focus on them in this chapter in the section about *Hotspots*. Also, Foxy should be able to pick up things to put in her inventory and interact with objects in her environment (after all, this *is* an adventure game!). Well don't worry; we'll cover that in this chapter as well when we talk about *Objects* and *Inventory Items*.
