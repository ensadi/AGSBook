# Summary

An adventure game becomes a lot more enjoyable and engrossing when it has some interaction.  Here are some of the ways a player can interact with your game:

* **Objects** Objects are things in your game that are moveable, as opposed to items that are part of a room's background.  Objects have their own attributes and events and can be manipulated through the game's script files.
* **Hotspots** Items that the player can interact with that are not moveable and are part of the room's background are called Hotspots.  These behave similarly to objects, but objects are more versatile.
* **Inventory Items** We discussed how to give your character inventory items, and how they are used in conjunction with objects to let the player interact with them on the screen.
* **NPCs** Characters that are not controlled by the player are called Non-player Characters, or NPCs.  All of the actions that an NPC does are controlled through the game script.  In this chapter we created an NPC named Dork the Duck that Foxy could interact with.
* **Custom Animations** If something in your game should animate, you have two options: either use the built-in views that are associated with every character (Normal View, Speech View, Idle View, etc.), or, if these don't suit your needs, you can create custom animations.
