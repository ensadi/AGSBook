# Interaction

So far, we've had Foxy walk around each room by clicking the little mouse icon (which looks like a shoe) on different parts of the screen.  But have you tried right-clicking?  We briefly mentioned this before, but let's try it again.  Load up the game and try it now.  You'll notice that your mouse cursor changes from a shoe to a magnifying glass ([Figure 4.1](#figure41)). If you right-click again, it will change to a hand, and if you right-click yet again it will change to a speech bubble with exclamation point and question mark.  If you continue to right-click, it will simply cycle back through these four mouse cursors.  (We know, this is all basic stuff but not everyone read the first chapter.)  Each of these mouse cursors represents a different action that the player can take.  The shoe, as we've seen, is used for walking; the maginifying glass is used for looking around; the hand is for interacting with things; and the speech bubble is used to talk to someone or something. When you left-click you are performing that action on whatever you left-clicked on.  Rocket science, right?

Notice, though, that none of the mouse modes does anything except the walk mode.  That's because we haven't told AGS to do anything with those modes yet!  That's all about to change.
