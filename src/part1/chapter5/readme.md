# Chapter 5 - Sounds and Music (Make Some Noise!)

We know what you're thinking: our game is great so far, but what about sounds and music?  (Or if you weren't thinking that then you are now, because we're Jedi and we make you think what we want you to think.)  Sounds and music are a very important part of any game, and AGS makes it simple to add them to your game.

In this chapter, we'll take a look at the different kinds of audio you can use in your game.  We'll show you how you can use standard sound effects when things happen in your game.  But AGS offers more than just that.  You can use ambient sounds like crickets chirping in the background, room music, and you can even give a voice to your characters and have them speak their lines.
