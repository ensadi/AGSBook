# Summary

In this chapter, we saw how AGS allows us to use sounds and music in our game through the use of sound effects, background music, and speech. 

* **Sound Effects**  Sound effects &lt;BANG!> are a cool way to &lt;POP!> give your game some realism &lt;WHIZZZ!> and help to engross your player &lt;CLAP! CLAP! CLAP!> into your game.  But just &lt;SSSREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!> make sure you don't get too annoying with &lt;SNARF!> the sound effects or it could &lt;BEEEEP!> cause your players to walk away &lt;CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH> in frustration!
* **Background Music** Every good game should have background music and with AGS it's a simple matter to play ambient music either on a room-by-room basis, or play music throughout your whole game.
* **Speech** If you have voice actors that can act out the speech in your game, then you can add those voices by just prepending the speech lines in your script with an ampersand (&) followed by the number of the speech file which contains the recorded audio for that line of text.
