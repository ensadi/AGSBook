# Chapter 3 - Rooms and Events

A game with no room is like a forest with no trees.  Now that we got the philosophy out of the way, let's give our friend Foxy Monk a better place to play than the default screen.  Like we said before, a room in AGS will contain the background graphic, any objects that are in the room, the room script, and many other things.

> **Side Note:** You can find the graphics for the following examples on <a href="https://github.com/ensadi/FoxysQuest/tree/main/backgrounds" target="_blank">https://github.com/ensadi/FoxysQuest/tree/main/backgrounds</a>
