# Scaling

When Foxy is walking around in the bathroom she looks like a little child who can't reach anything.  Foxy is not a little child though.  We have to make sure she fits into her surroundings well, especially if she needs to use the toilet.  Let's scale her up a notch when she's in the bathroom.  Edit the bathroom and choose the room's walkable area.  In the Properties Pane, change the `ScalingLevel` propery to 220.  Take Foxy into the bathroom and check it out.  She's HUMONGOUS.

Let's also add some scaling in the Long Room.  It would be nice if Foxy got smaller as she walked towards the back wall since she's walking away from us.    There's another property called `UseContinuousScaling`, which is set to `False` by default. Turning this option on will replace the `ScalingLevel` property with two new ones called `MinScalingLevel` and `MaxScalingLevel`. This will cause Foxy to gradually change her scaling as she moves from the bottom of the room to the top.  The "Min" property is the top and the "Max" is the bottom. Edit the Long Room and view its walkable areas.  Change the `UseContinuousScaling` property to `True` and set the "Min" to 100 and the "Max" to 200. This will cause Foxy to get smaller as she moves to the back of the room.  Run the game and make Foxy walk next to the green table on the right of the room.  You should notice that she gets smaller and her head stays mostly in the same position relative to the table.
