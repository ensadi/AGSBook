# Summary

In this chapter, we learned about how to create your first character, and along the way we learned about sprites and views.

* **Sprites** Sprites are the individual graphics that are in your game; for example, the animations that are associated to a character are each made up of one or more sprites.  Sprites aren't just for animations, though.  A button's image is a sprite, and so is the mouse cursor image.  Sprites are imported and managed through the Sprites editor in the Project Tree.
* **Views** Views are collections of animations.  An individual animation is called a Loop.  Views are made up of one or more Loops.  Loops that contain grapes, apples, and oranges are called Fruit Loops.
* **Characters** Your game has to contain at least one character, and most games will have many more than that.  Characters that the player controls are called Player Characters (PCs), and characters that are computer-controlled are called Non-Player Characters (NPCs).  More on NPCs later.
