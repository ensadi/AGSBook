# Chapter 2 - Sprites, Views, and Characters

A quick revisit of what sprites, views, and characters are is in order here.  Sprites are simply images within the game.  Because a character animates, it usually takes several sprites to make up a character.  Views are, simply put, collections of sprites that make up animations.  So basically, characters are made up of views which in turn are made up of sprites.
