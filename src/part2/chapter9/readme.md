# Chapter 9 - Cutscenes

In this chapter we're going to learn how to make cutscenes.  A cutscene is a sequence which the player has no control over.  Basically, it's like a little movie that the player watches.  You can use the cutscene to move the story along, introduce new things, show a conversation, or even show credits at the beginning or end of a game.
