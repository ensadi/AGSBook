# Summary

In this chapter, we learned how to create cutscenes, and got introduced to a few concepts to help us along the way:

* **StartCutscene and EndCutscene** You can create cutscenes by placing script between these two functions.
* **Into and End Credits** You can use cutscenes to create nice intro and end credit screens.
* **Overlays** You can create both graphical and text overlays to place on top of your cutscenes, such as the game's title or the authors' names.
* **Colors** You can use the colors editor to find nice colors to use in your cutscenes.
