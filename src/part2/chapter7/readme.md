# Chapter 7 - Timers and Randomization

This chapter is the first in a line of more advanced topics. You should already know enough to create a game now, but what we're going to teach you in Part 2 will make your games even more fantastic.  In this chapter we're going to explore the concepts of timers and randomization.  Timers allow you to do something continuously on a schedule.  Randomization allows you to make things happen randomly; for example, you can make Dork the Duck say something randomly to Foxy when Foxy interacts with him instead of always just quacking.
