# Summary

You should know better than to talk to yourself.
In this chapter, we learned how to create all kinds of ways to have conversations:

* **Using the Dialog Editor** You can create dialogs easily by using the built-in dialog editor.  You can create different conversation options and turn them on and off using `option-on` and `option-off`.
* **Mixing AGS Scripts and Dialog Scripts** You can put regular AGS Scripts inside of Dialog Scripts by indenting them in.
* **Controlling dialogs with AGS Scripts** You can control dialogs from any AGS Script by using dialog control functions like `Start()`, `SetOptionState()`, and `GetOptionState()`.
* **Jumping between dialogs** You can jump between dialogs using `goto-dialog` and `goto-previous`.
* **And, of course, the Text Parser** AGS includes an easy-to-use text parser for making great text-based games.
