# Chapter 8 - Spoken Dialog

In this chapter we're going to dive into the world of dialogs.  You don't have to have dialogs between characters to have a good game but giving your players the ability to choose what to talk about can greatly enhance the gaming experience.  Wow, that last sentence must have been written by an English major.  Anyway, Dialogs will give your players different choices for responses in conversations.  This will allow the conversation to go in many different directions.  You can even go as far as make different endings or different outcomes depending on what choices the player makes in conversations.  Enough high falloutin' talk.  Let's dive right in.
